# Demo 1: Rapid Prototyping with v0.dev

## Overview

This exercise demonstrates how to rapidly prototype a user interface using the v0.dev platform. The goal is to create a timesheet entry screen that allows users to select a week and add rows for each project/task.

## Steps

1. Navigate to https://v0.app/chat and log in with your credentials.

1. Drag the whiteboard.jpg file into the chat and enter the following prompt:
    ```
    I am building a timesheet entry screen. The user should have the ability to select a week (starting on Sunday) and add rows to a timesheet. There should be one row per project/task, and an hour entry field for each day of the week in the row. Rows can be added and removed. Generate the UI using the attached image.
    ```

1. Experiment with the generated UI and make any necessary adjustments.
    Example prompt:
    ```
    Add a footer row that totals hours across all rows
    ```

# Summary

This exercise demonstrates how to rapidly prototype a user interface using the v0.dev platform. Tools like v0.dev enable quick iterations and refinements, making it easier to design and test user interfaces in a collaborative environment.
